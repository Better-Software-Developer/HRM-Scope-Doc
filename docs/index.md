# Introduction

This documentation encompasses the scope for my personal project **HRM - Home Resource Manager**. The idea is keep this document upto date with the developing application code.

## Motivation

The motivation to develop this project comes from the fact that to become better developer it is just not enough to keep learning using resources such as videos, blogs, books, etc. In order to become a truly effective software developer to me it is more important to develop applications that solves problems. Through this path, it is for sure I will develop something, which might be inefficient or ugly to start of with. But the goal is to learn from these mistakes, make myself and the application better as my knowledge develops. Thus I feel, when I see down the years, this application should give me a rough idea on where I started to where I am now.

Hopefully, in this journey I can learn a lot and enjoy the process.

## About Application

For the above motivation, I was in search of an idea that will help me to start this journey. I had numerous ideas like building a clone of existing application, etc. But at the end felt that in order to improve my development and architectural skills it is good to have an idea that is solvable and is usable for my personal needs. Thus when I looked at the problems I was facing in my home it was apparent that it was difficult to manage the Household resources for example, keeping tab of electricity bills, property taxes, water taxes, and more. That too it becomes very difficult, when we have multiple properties to manage. This problem is what I am gonna try to solve using this application.
