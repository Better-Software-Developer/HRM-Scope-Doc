## Frontend Requirements

In the long run, the idea is to develop Micro-Frontend suite of applications. But to start of with we will start with below requirements. The main idea is to follow **Shift Left** approach

    - React will be used as frontend library
    - Unit test coverage from first using Jest and React Testing Library
    - Unit test should also cover accessibility tests
    - Use Cypress for E2E testing
    - Have linting & Formatting setup
    - Use vite for bundler
    - Pipeline using GitHub Actions to deploy code

### Backend Requirements

In the long run, the idea is have suite of Microservices following best practices from Microservices Patterns book and to use variety of programming languages that interest me like JavaScript, Rust, and Go Programming. Below are the initial scope.

    - NodeJs as first server runtime
    - Jest for unit and integration testing
    - PostgreSQL as database
    - Sequelize as ORM
    - Have linting & Formatting setup
    - Pipeline using GitHub Actions to deploy code

Please note the above requirements will be updated as I learn and develop applications.
