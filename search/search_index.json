Through this path, it is for sure I will develop something, which might be inefficient or ugly to start of with. But the goal is to learn from these mistakes, make myself and the application better as my knowledge develops. Thus I feel, when I see down the years, this application should give me a rough idea on where I started to where I am now.</p> <p>Hopefully, in this journey I can learn a lot and enjoy the process.</p>"},{"location":"#about-application","title":"About Application","text":"<p>For the above motivation, I was in search of an idea that will help me to start this journey. I had numerous ideas like building a clone of existing application, etc. But at the end felt that in order to improve my development and architectural skills it is good to have an idea that is solvable and is usable for my personal needs. Thus when I looked at the problems I was facing in my home it was apparent that it was difficult to manage the Household resources for example, keeping tab of electricity bills, property taxes, water taxes, and more. That too it becomes very difficult, when we have multiple properties to manage. This problem is what I am gonna try to solve using this application.</p>"},{"location":"ACD/","title":"Architecure Concept Defintion","text":"<p>HRM (Home Resource Manager) applications goal is to help me in managing resources such as Electricty, Water bills, Property taxes, etc. This will include all the ideas that arise to me as I go along developing this application.

But to start of with we will start with below requirements. The main idea is to follow Shift Left approach</p> <pre><code>- React will be used as frontend library\n- Unit test coverage from first using Jest and React Testing Library\n- Unit test should also cover accessibility tests\n- Use Cypress for E2E testing\n- Have linting &amp; Formatting setup\n- Use vite for bundler\n- Pipeline using GitHub Actions to deploy code\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Technical/#backend-requirements","title":"Backend Requirements","text":"<p>In the long run, the idea is have suite of Microservices following best practices from Microservices Patterns book and to use variety of programming languages that interest me like JavaScript, Rust, and Go Programming. Below are the initial scope.</p> <pre><code>- NodeJs as first server runtime\n- Jest for unit and integration testing\n- PostgreSQL as database\n- Sequelize as ORM\n- Have linting &amp; Formatting setup\n- Pipeline using GitHub Actions to deploy code\n</code></pre> <p>Please note the above requirements will be updated as I learn and develop applications.</p>"}]}
